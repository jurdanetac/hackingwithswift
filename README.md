## Progress
- ✅ Day 0 (09/29/25): Article that covers the introduction to the 100 Days of Swift course itself, the Swift programming language (and SwiftUI), tips and advice on learning how to build apps for Apple devices and not die trying
- ✅ Day 1 (09/30/25-10/01/25): Variables, constants, strings, and numbers. Found out Swift's got some nifty things such as not letting you mix data types (e.g. trying to sum an `Int` and a `Double` will raise an error) and some neat string methods by default like `hasSuffix`
